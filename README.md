# READ FIRST
After some careful consideration, we've come to realise that RTCFly doesn't work as well as we want it to in its current form, so we have decided to rebuild. 

This master branch will be branched into "Legacy" and the project will be replaced with a better one. 

Checkout the `next` branch to see the upcoming project.

RTCFly is quite a young project, so we don't have too many examples yet, but see some below

This [example app](https://github.com/elmarti/meteor-video-chat-example) uses the [Meteor Video Chat](https://github.com/elmarti/meteor-video-chat) plugin which is has RTCFly at its core.
