# CoreRTC [COMING SOON]
At present, this module doesn't work, but it will soon!

### What is it? 
WebRTC can get pretty annoying. It's fun, but annoying. There are a load of polyfills and frameworks out there, but nothing that makes it easy to just build with WebRTC. 

This project seeks to provide a simple way of integrating 1 to 1 WebRTC into your projects.


###Current State
This project was created in an effort to better abstract and unit test my meteor video chat extension
[meteor-video-chat](https://www.github.com/elmarti/meteor-video-chat) and I am currently in the process of integrating it.

Completing this integration will provide the concept and will allow me to document the process on integrating core-rtc into other projects. 

Checkout the development branch of meteor-video-chat [here](https://github.com/elmarti/meteor-video-chat/tree/integrate-with-core-js)
